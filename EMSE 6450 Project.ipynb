    "In this project, we will explore the Markowitz model, the basis of modern portfolio theory established by Harry Markowitz <a href=\"https://www.math.ust.hk/~maykwok/courses/ma362/07F/markowitz_JF.pdf\">in 1952</a> for which he won the Nobel Prize in economics. This model addresses the trade-off between risk and expected returns and seeks to mathematically determine the least-risk portfolio for any desired return. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the tools Markowitz gave us, we no longer have to sift through all feasible portfolios, hoping to arrive upon the perfect one. Instead, we can numerically (and sometimes analytically) establish an <i>efficient frontier</i> consisting only of efficient (i.e. minimum risk for maximum return) portfolios, then choose from these the portfolio that fits our personal appetite for risk. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the sections that follow, we will first accomplish this using the <b>two-fund theorem</b> and a set of risky stocks. We will then move on to include a risk-free treasury note, and will use the <b>one-fund theorem</b> to update our model. Finally, we will use these models to inform our investment decisions, and will look into how we might further try to assess and manage risk."

    "To get started, we must obtain historical stock quotes from <a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com\"> Yahoo Finance </a>. The first step is to access a CSV file called `dow.csv` and extract the ticker symbols of the 30 stocks used in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. We'll use these as our available stocks going forward. The Dow is actually an <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/09/10/the-dow-jones-industrial-average-is-ridiculous/?utm_term=.5d45156d4c28\"> utterly terrible </a> financial indicator, but is convenient for our purposes because the companies included are well-established and 30 is a manageable number of stocks to consider. This analysis could actually be done using a vast number of stocks (say, the S&P 500), but for the sake of simplicity and computing time, we'll consider only those in the Dow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The historical period in question will be a nice, even 17 years, extending from Y2K to New Years Day 2017. The analysis gets stronger as the period in question is lengthened and more data is considered, so it can be tempting to download data going back 50 years or more. We can't do this, though, because many of the stocks we're considering weren't around that long ago. One might think the limiting factor here is Cisco, the Dow's youngest constituent stock, which went public in 1990. Interestingly though, Goldman Sachs - the oldest investment bank on Wall Street - only <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/1999/05/03/markets/goldman/\">became a publicly traded company</a> in 1999. So that is why we must settle for a measly 17 years of data. However, 17 years is practically an eon on the stock market (long enough to see two recessions and the near-doubling of the Dow) so we should be fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started by importing some important Python libraries that we'll need, accessing those stock ticker symbols, and grabbing the historical prices from the web."

    "With the means and covariance calculated, the stage is set and we can finally get into the really interesting stuff. We're going to take a look at exactly what the Markowitz model is and how we can use it. In the Markowitz model, we pick some desired, possibly arbitrary rate of return, $\\alpha$, then find the feasible portfolio with the least variance (i.e. least risk) that achieves this return. It boils down to a minimization of the objective, variance, subject to portfolio return being equal to $\\bar{r}$ and the weights of each stock (i.e. what percentage of funds are used to buy shares of that stock) summing to 1. The problem can be described thusly\n",

    "\n",
    "So what is that next step? Finding an analytical solution of course! We can accomplish this by converting our optimization problem into a <i>Lagrangian</i>. First, each constraint equation is rearranged so that the right-hand side is zero. They are then each multiplied by a device called a <i>Lagrange multiplier</i>, $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$ in our case, and subtracted from the objective function. This yields the Lagrangian\n",

Secondly, in a typical stock purchase, the investor can only lose up to the amount of capital invested, as an asset's value can only drop to zero and no further.

    "Looking at this plot, we can make a few observations about our restricted portfolio. Firstly, its minimum-variance point has roughly the same return as the unrestricted portfolio, but is slightly riskier. Secondly, it has a finite \"end\" at the right. Even if we were to widen the range of risk values the simulation may consider, that point will always be the highest risk, highest return portfolio possible. This is due to our restriction on short selling. Finally, if we look more deeply into the weights of this specific scenario, it becomes apparent that the high-risk/high-return portfolio involves investing in only a single stock (Apple, in this case). Why then, does the curve not stop right at the point where we see the 'AAPL' data plotted? This simply is a result of imperfections in the solver used (ECOS, in this case), and it is something we must always be weary of when applying numerical solving methods. A different solver (e.g. GPLK, CVXOPT) may serve this problem better, but that is beyond the scope of this project."

    "Just as there was no nice, closed-form way to solve for the two-fund efficient frontier without short selling, the same goes for the tangent line in the one-fund theorem. We will have to use a more numerical, brute-force approach  by calculating $\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}$ for each small segment along our generated efficient frontier ($y$ here of course implying portfolio returns and $x$ implying standard deviation), then rearranging the classic $y=mx+b$ linear equation to yield $b = y-mx = y - \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}x$. Here, $b$ is used to denote the y-axis intercept, which in our case represents the zero-variance return of the tangent line. We can repeat this for every point along our efficient frontier, then parse the results to find which tangent line passes through our risk-free return ratio. Once we find that, we've got our restricted one-fund theorem efficient frontier!"

Along every step of the way, an approach to these problems using Python programming has been demonstrated. Hopefully, you have found the project easy to read and follow, and will feel comfortable building on these tools in your own studies.\n",

Perhaps chief among these is the assumption that while stock returns and variances are random variables, the covariance matrix is actually an unchanging feature of the universe. This is not the case, however, and the covariance between stocks in the past may have no bearing on their covariance in the future. \n",
